COLMENA (COLaboración entre dispositivos Mediante tecnología de ENjAmbre) aims to ease the development, deployment, operation and maintenance of extremely-high available, reliable and intelligent services running seamlessly across the device-edge-cloud continuum. It leverages a swarm approach organising a dynamic group of autonomous, collaborative nodes following an agile, fully-decentralised, robust, secure and trustworthy open architecture.
